# Patrick Burke - Econ 372 Final Project

## Project Overview:
  This is the code to my final project for Econ372 (Health Care Markets) at Emory University. The project involved collecting data regarding hospital gross charges, negotiated payments, and medicare payments for selected procedures and comparing them between markets. I selected 5 procedures, represented by DRG codes, and analyzed them across 10 New York City Hospitals. Half of these hospitals were located in the Bronx and half were located in my hometown of Queens.
  
### Hospital Transparency Law
